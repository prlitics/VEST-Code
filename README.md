# VEST

These repositories stores the datasets I've constructed in my work for **V**oting and **E**lections **S**cience **T**eam (**VEST.**)[https://twitter.com/vest_team]

Currently, I have done work with the Florida shapefile for its 2018 and 2016 general elections. 

## Language and Software
The splitting of the precincts needed to construct the shapefiles for the state house and senate races, as well as the federal house race, was perforemd in QGIS (3.4.12). The aggregation and manipulation of state-provided precint-level data, and its merging with the shapefiles, was performed in R (3.5.2). The code used for the manipulations and merges are located in their associated folders.

## Data Present
**2018**
* Statewide races
* Federal House races
* State House races
